# Warmup: Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.

## Assignment 1

1. Using iteration, write a method _**#fibs**_ which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.
2. Now write another method **_#fibs_rec_** which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).

# Project: Merge Sort

We spent some time early on dealing with sorting (e.g. bubble sort). Now it’s time to take another look at sorting with Merge Sort, a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than bubble sort on the right data sets. You’ll build a method which sorts a given array but uses a “merge sort” method for doing so.

It can be a bit strange to wrap your head around, but just remember you’re “dividing and conquering” the problem.

## Assignment 2

1. Build a method **_#merge_sort_** that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
